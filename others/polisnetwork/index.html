  <h2>Customizable</h2>
  <p>How do you want which campaign to display? Pick one randomly, or maybe rotate every 10 seconds? No worries, it's your own private ads network and should follow your rules. You can customize how you want to display your ads, be it size, background color, or percentage of random appearance of a particular ad campaign. We have you all covered!</p>

  <div id="features2"></div>
  <h2>Native Ad</h2>
  <p>The native ad allows you to inject ad content into the website directly to share the same style with your website. It looks and feels natural, just like other content on the page, and thus provides a better engagement rate than the traditional iframe space ad.</p>

<div style="position: relative;max-width:500px;padding:15px;">
  <div id="features3"></div>
  <h2>Privacy Friendly</h2>
  <p>We built PolisNetwork with the user's privacy in mind. We don't track users across websites and sell their data to third parties as most traditional ad networks do. The data we collect on your behalf is only to provide you with analytical insights.</p>
</div>

  <div id="features4"></div>
  <h2>Performance Insights (coming soon)</h2>
  <p>We empower you with the ad performance data we collected for you and our powerful yet easy-to-use analytics tools to have insights for optimizing the performance of ads. You can also track the click rate of links in the ads and the conversation rate.</p>
</div>

<div style="position: relative;max-width:500px;padding:15px;">
  <div id="features5"></div>
  <h2>Custom Domain (coming soon)</h2>
  <p>PolisNetwork allows you to serve your ads from your domain name, so it's more unlikely to be blocked by an ad blocker.</p>
</div>

<div style="position: relative;max-width:500px;padding:15px;">
  <div id="features6"></div>
  <h2>Content Injection (coming soon)</h2>
  <p>To avoid the ad content being blocked by an ad blocker, the ads can be injected by our reverse proxy directly into the HTML of your website before responding to the user.</p>

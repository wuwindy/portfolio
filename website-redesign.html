                                <p>The reason for the webpage reconstruction was primarily due to the outdated nature of the original website. Additionally, the product pages on the original website lacked completeness. Therefore, the goal of this project was to redevelop the website from the ground up, focusing on overall architecture and product presentation. The aim was to provide users visiting the website with a better user experience.</p>

                                <p>As a product designer, in the early stages, I focused on the reconstruction of the information architecture to define the navigation menu for the new official website. In areas where the categorization of the latest news is more complex, I utilized the card sorting method and engaged in discussions with team members to define corresponding categories.<br>In terms of visual design, I established a design system for the official website to ensure a consistent overall design. Additionally, I implemented continuous monitoring of the website's effectiveness through SEO and Google Analytics. This serves as a consideration for design iterations and improvements.</p>

These discussions covered the definition of navigation bars and categories to ensure the rationality of the navigation structure and news classification during the redesign process.</p>
